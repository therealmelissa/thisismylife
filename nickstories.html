            <p>your presence is what gets me going. knowing you exist and that i met you makes me nourished inside. your presence is what makes me whole. the way you glance at me and say the most profound things. your presence just makes me happy and buoyant. your presence lives within me, since day one. </p>

            <h1>"Happy Birthday Baby Boy"</h1>
            <p>It’s been four weeks since we last spoke. It’s been four months since we last saw each other. You don’t have to bother replying back, or unblocking me, or hey, even sending me a letter. I just want to clear my thoughts so I can move on.
                <br>
                <br>
          Firstly, all I wanted for us was to be happy, and drink wine, supporting each other. We didn’t have to be in a relationship or anything for that matter. All I ever wanted was to conversate with you, maybe go out on one last joy ride, but we couldn’t. Why? Because you decided to leave me with no explanation or anything. You unfollowed me, left me on seen, and still had the audacity to look for a “Taurus”. Give me a f_^*% break man. 
                <br>
                <br>
        Secondly, everything I did for you, (buy lingerie for you, buy different types of paint for you, and canvases just in case you didn’t have any, wine so we can laugh and drink at our problems, and candles because I thought hey, I really want to be romantic) I did it because I f**** with you heavy. Like heavy heavy. But you know what, you want to f*** with females that don’t give a f*** about you and just make you feel like shit, alright then, do you love. 
                <br>
     Thirdly, if you don’t want any of my stuff, please JUST GIVE IT BACK TO ME! Don’t throw it away. Especially my painting, because I designed it specifically for your use. 
      All I wanted was for us to be happy. I guess my dream didn’t come true. </p>

            <h1>"How we met"</h1>
            <p>This story is about a guy I met at Walmart. A guy I’m in love with. Yes. I am in love with this guy. I ... I don’t know. When I say I love someone it’s not real. But I truly love this guy. He’s ... he’s just so indescribable. His name? Nick. Yeah, that’s all. Nick. I don’t know his last name or middle or nickname. Nothing. 
                <br>
Nick, I just want you to know that I’m really sorry for everything I put US through. I’m so grateful I met you. You probably don’t feel the same about me and yes that’s ok and yes I’ll be ok. I just want you to know that I’ll always be here if you need me. You were something special to me. Our love was so passionate and I loved every bit of it. There is no man on this planet that could complete me like you do. If you throw this away please know that.. well, I’d like to take you and your fish on a mini date. You know, if you want to. No pressure. 
Thank you for loving me for me. </p>
