        <h1>"COOL FEELING"</h1>
            <p>
It was that cool feeling I couldn't describe. <br>
That feeling that made me fall for you last time. <br>
That feeling that had me crying on my worst nights. <br>
Something that was real, not pinned as a lie. <br>
When I felt the warmth of your skin pressing against mine,<br>
and your hands gripped around my neck <br>
I felt so aroused <br>
It felt so pleasing <br>
I love when you please me.<br> 
I can't leave you for someone else, because I felt so connected to you<br> 
I can't say much, but I wanted to know if you would be my boo? <br>
No, not for the summer, <br>
or just a one time thing,<br>
But something sentimental that only you and I could bring.<br> 
</p>

            <h1>"A POEM FOR Z.M."</h1>
            <p>this is a poem for a kid i just met. <br> 
somebody that surprisingly makes me really wet. <br> 
we got into a mess and it's all my fault <br> 
i didn't know what to do, i was just being an adult <br> 
i had this weird feeling and i didnt know what to do <br> 
i'm sorry if i made you feel like some type of fool <br> 
i'm sitting in the backseat, thinking about you <br> 
you make me feel whole, and i love that too. <br> 
if you ever feel uncomfortable let me know please. <br> 
i just want to make you feel guaranteed. <br> 
these are just my thoughts that cause me to feel this way. <br> 
authenticity, that's the only thing making me stay. <br> 
speak your mind, and tell me what i lack<br> 
i promise i'll be everything you want me to be, just point out what i slack. <br> 
i'll always keep you first, not last. <br> 
i'll try to be the best soul you ever had, erasing your past. <br> 
you put me in a position where i could pick and choose, <br> 
but oh well, i felt too amuse to deny your view <br> 
if in a few weeks, your vibe for me switches <br> 
just know, you left my heart with a few stitches. </p>

                        <h1>"MY LIFE CHANGED"</h1>
            <p>
It was that day where you were sitting down <br>
And I surprised you with my words. <br>
That day when you couldn't connect anything because in your head you thought "she's such a nerd" <br>
I walked up to you in the stairs while you were on your phone <br>
You looked so peaceful, in your zone <br>
We hugged passionately and I felt every power you had within. <br>
Where have you been? <br>
We walked into burger king to chill <br>
We had such a thrill<br>
Playing games about Frank Ocean. <br>
Laughing, being in rhythm, having a steady motion. <br>
After our little game we decided to be children, play dodge ball and sneak up on indecisive robots.<br>
As we played, I looked at you for a second and I just wanted to make love to you, then telling you my thoughts. <br>
not caring if we got caught<br>
You looked so magnificent in your "Rolling Stones" shirt, <br>
Every time I looked up, I just wanted to flirt. <br>
You had those eyes that glistened in the dark<br>
That was enough for me to leave you with a mark. <br>
We don't know what comes after this. <br>
Maybe, you'll hold onto me and i'll never let go. <br> 
Maybe, this is a one time thing, but just know, <br>
when i'm with you, there is no tomorrow <br>
The attachment we have connected to our tongues is what brought us closer 
Our first date was such a rollercoaster. <br>
Our warm secluded bodies touched each other 
One grab after another. <br>
The feel of your skin grappling against my a**, 
bringing me closer to you. <br>
I wanted every moment to last, yes with you.<br> 
I don't care about the girl you fell in love with, because I'll be the best you ever had. <br>
You'll probably convert me into someone so bad. <br>
I'll be so bad, you're going to want to subtract. <br>
Take my word for it. <br>
and you'll see <br>
this wasn't a dream, not a fantasy, but something that happened while I was drastically asleep. <br>
It was late, and we soon had to leave. <br>
I tried my best to retrieve <br>
that moment we last gained. <br>
Where we were both laying down, looking up at the stars, realizing we entered space. <br>
thinking what would come next. <br>
You got rejected once, and that soon is <br>
gonna make me fall in love with you, Zachary Muniz.<br>
