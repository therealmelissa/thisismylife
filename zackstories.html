<h1>"MY THOUGHTS"</h1>
            <p>
October 2nd, 2019 <br>
The day we stopped talking. The last day we completely stopped talking, the first thing I felt was... betrayal. I loved you so much even though I was still searching for that word and meaning. That last time we spoke on the phone and we ended on horrible terms, I cried. I cried because I lost the biggest thing I ever had. You made me feel so unbelievably different. I felt so hurt, because you hurt me. You burned my damn soul and took it with you. Everything I did, was for you. It was as if you just knew what I liked, making me fall for you even more. We connected so much and that connection faded away, and I don't want to blame you but I just wish that you cared more, like you just accepted my complications (bipolar, aggressiveness, paranoia, questioning). I wished so much for us, not future related but relationship status. Just please, please don't ever forget me. I saw you liked my pictures and saw my story, and hit me up. I just want you to know that you're just ... indescribably amazing and I hope someone loves you like I did. You said you missed me, but clearly didn't believe me when I told you I didn't do anything with Ernesto. 

P.S. I didn't want to move on, but I had to. I tried and I don't think it's working because I still have feelings for you. Ugh, I just want you back. I need you baby. </p>

            <h1>"As I try"</h1>
            <p>as i try to find someone who can profess their love like you did, i just can't. the hardest thing about us was saying goodbye, without having a proper hello. i just want to cry and wish you would come back and love me again. </p>

            <h1>Feelings for zachary m. another love. </h1>
            <p>the things i want to say in person, i can't anymore. 
it's crazy, we almost made a month. 
aren't you glad? 
you made me feel so burnt in my soul. the words coming out of your mouth hurt me so badly i couldn't function. i didn't know how. 
i'm sorry about this whole combustion. 
you did it to yourself. 
i'm not saying you're a victim, nor putting you on the spot. 
just wanted reassurance and peace is all. 
    the first time we met, you were so calm and assured that i was going to take good care of you. you trusted me with your body and your brain but not your heart. you knew something was up and you couldn't let go. 
      the second time we met, we felt something so deep. it was so passionate even without the music. even with human beings watching us. we didn't care. we were so reckless and free. "we" were we. 
       the third time i accompanied you to get your first tattoo. i wonder what was going through your mind when you got it. i wonder what's going through your mind right now, this second at 12:38AM. I wonder. i wonder if you'd be happy to see me when you got up and not your last love. i wonder. 
       the fourth time we met, the vibe kind of fell off and broke into a shell that couldn't get fixed. 
you were dismissed and i gave you a kiss. i picked you up and we spoke about the past that was so irrelevant. then we spent hours speaking to your friends. what happened zack? what happened to "us" ?
       the last time. man. the last time we talked, saw each other's faces and actually felt connected was the last time we ever saw each other. i miss you endlessly. i miss your scent. your home depot scent. i miss your hair. your nails. your body. your hands. your eyes. your ears. i'm everything you wish i wasn't, and that's okay. i wish i was everything you ever wanted.</p>
                
<h4>mel's note: 
i've always had a thing for you. i thought we meant something to you. i guess not. you say i'm rushing things but you said you wanted a relationship. right then and there. you don't even know me zack. zack, i .... i really love you. like a love that's different from other loves. a love that made me paint you paintings that expressed so much emotions. a love that only i could express through poems. a love that had me crying on my worst nights. if only we had more communication skills with each other and illustrated how we felt rather than putting our anger towards.. you know.. things would've been different if we've just vibed instead of being a couple of freaks. 
this is the end for us, just know, you were the second best thing that ever happened to me. thank you.</h4>
