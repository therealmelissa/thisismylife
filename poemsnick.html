        <h1>"November 13th"</h1>
            <p>
It was November <br>
A time to remember <br>
A time where all you can think about was the weather <br>
I met you in the daytime<br>
Where you can think and watch the sunrise <br>
You asked me if I needed help<br>
I had no choice but to say “Might as well”<br>
We spoke, we laughed, we smiled<br>
Then you turned around and said “wait a while”<br>
As you left <br>
I prayed to god and hoped you were the best<br>
Your fragrance was so arousing <br>
It had my heart pounding <br>
November 13th was the intro <br>
The day you gave me your info <br>
You decided to leave <br>
Not me <br>
You left me, here to please someone else <br>
Don’t come back to me when you know I’m being treated well. </p>

           <h1>"CONNECTION"</h1>
            <p>I wrote this poem just for you <br>
A poem that I know can be true<br>
Our connection can be dense <br>
I can only understand the best<br>
Of us <br>
Of “this” <br>
I don’t want to lose you, but I also don’t want you to forget me <br>
I’m tired of all the things I put us through <br>
I hope you can forgive me too <br>
Love from the bottom of my heart <br>
Truth from the inside of my soul<br>
Respect, respect from all around my body <br>
Because you, you embody <br>
The essence of everything <br>
Shall we drink? <br>
To a brand new year with good health, romance and beautiful things <br>
I’m writing you this poem because I care <br>
Because deep down, I always did, and I wish you were there. <br>
To a guy I digged. <br>
</p>

            <h1>"THINK OF US"</h1>
            <p>
I think you and I are different breeds <br>
But we entirely <br>
Need to identify our reality of trust<br>
For different needs <br>
Sorry for the discretion <br>
Of lust<br>
I loved you from the day we met<br>
I loved you from the day we just...<br> 
stopped talking <br>
Stop all the nonsense<br> 
Think about something you lost and try to gain it back with just concepts<br> 
It’s different right?<br>
It's not every day you find a female that sacrificed love for you and sits there calmly saying “alright” to all of your mistakes and wrong doings<br> 
Please don’t do me <br>
Like you did her <br>
I’m not anybody you’ll forget<br> 
I’m just that girl you met at Walmart on a Tuesday<br> 
Just like c’est. </p>
